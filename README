This is the LinOTP pam module, which will send the username and
password - including otp - to the LinOTP-server to verify.

Thus you can login via OTP to every service that supports pam.

copy your /etc/pam.d/common_auth to something like /etc/pam.d/linotp_auth and replace the line
   auth ...... pam_unix.so

with
   auth ...... pam_linotp.so

Now you can use the
  @include linotp_auth
in every service you want to authenticate with OTP.

Config options to be set in the pam configuration:
        url=http://localhost:5001/validate/simplecheck
        nosslhostnameverify
        nosslcertverify
        realm=<yourRealm>
        realm_file=<perUserRealmFilename>
        resConf=<specialResolverConfig>


Have fun.
